## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Details

### 1. HTML Structure
- Written in **semantic HTML5** for accessibility and SEO.  
- Sections are wrapped in `<section>` tags with IDs for navigation.  
- `<nav>` elements are used for both desktop and mobile menus.  
- Buttons and links are used instead of forms to keep the website lightweight.  

### 2. Styling with CSS
- **Flexbox** is the main layout tool, ensuring alignment across different screen sizes.  
- **Media queries** handle responsiveness:
  - Up to **1400px** for large screens.  
  - Up to **1200px** for tablets.  
  - Up to **600px** for small mobile devices.  
- **Transitions and hover effects** are applied to buttons, links, and icons.  
- Consistent design using **Google Fonts (Poppins)**.  

### 3. JavaScript Functionality
- JavaScript is minimal, focusing only on the **hamburger menu toggle**.  
- A function `toggleMenu()` adds/removes the `.open` class, which triggers CSS transitions.  
- No external libraries or frameworks are used, keeping the site **lightweight and fast**.  

### 4. Responsiveness
- The project heavily relies on **CSS Media Queries** to adjust layout.  
- Images and text containers resize dynamically for different devices.  
- Navigation adapts to smaller screens with a slide-down menu.  

### 5. Deployment on GitHub Pages
- Since it is a **static website**, no backend is required.  
- Deployment is done via GitHub Pages: simply push to the `main` branch and enable Pages in settings.  
- The site is hosted at `https://negarys.github.io/NegarYS-Portfolio/`.
